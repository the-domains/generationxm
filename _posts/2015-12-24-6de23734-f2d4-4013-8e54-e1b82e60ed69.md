Despite what Floridians might tell you, there are many great things about Minneapolis and the Twin Cities area. The parties - like the Cocktailian at The Depot. The Walker Art Center. Hell, even in winter it's worth going for the St. Paul Carnival. 

But one thing Minneapolis has always excelled at, for me, is music - the most obvious name to drop here is Prince, but the Twin Cities is responsible for a raft of great musicians over the years.

While not heralding from MPLS, but based there after growing up in Detroit (another great melting pot of talent), Lizzo is a name you need to lock away in your databanks for 2016\.

If you like your hip-hop with an experimental edge, a side order of truthful honesty, and a sprinkle of humor, Lizzo will be your cup of iced tea. Think "female Childish Gambino," and you'll get somewhere close.

Lizzo's new album just dropped - "Big GRRRL Small World" - which you can listen to via all good music suppliers and streamers (and the bad ones too), or grab yourself a free MP3 download of the album by [subscribing to her mailing list][0].
